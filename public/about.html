<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello Guys this is Niha Solkar here,I am an engineering student made this small project using just html .
  I was in second year when I started this course,hopefully it would be of very great use in future as I am a computer science student .

<p>If you want to try this there's a great bootcamp by Angela .She was my mentor for this web development,all thanks to my best friend for suggesting
  this course.Web development is a must do course for all the hackathon projects or to be a freelancer .I chose this to work for my miniprojects and ongoing 
  hackathon projects,I made this small project just to ensure I am good to go with HTML as said by my mentor.
